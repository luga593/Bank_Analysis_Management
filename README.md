Welcome to the Bank Analysis Management project. COMING SOON: you will be able to acess the live website. 
Currently you can donwload an examine the code yourself.
Without connection to an structured database, you will not be able to visualize most of the pages though.

If you do get that far, then you can test the functionanility of the webapplication by uploading the different bank transaction files (on the root directory)
and see how different transactions are flagged differently on the chartspages. 
All transactions in the sample files are manufactured and do NOT contain to real personal data.
