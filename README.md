Welcome to the Bank Analysis Management project. COMING SOON: you will be able to acess the live website. 
Currently, you can download and examine the code yourself.
Without a connection to a structured database, you will not be able to visualize most of the pages though.

If you do get that far, then you can test the functionality of the web application by uploading the different bank transaction files (on the root directory)
and see how different transactions are flagged differently on the charts pages. 
All transactions in the sample files are manufactured and do NOT contain real personal data.
